<html:p>
Contains text and possibly other information about screens (cards).
</html:p>
<html:p>
It is difficult to tell if a "card" refers to the entire file, or
to one of the string entries in the file.  The terms are confusingly
used interchangably in this file.
</html:p>
<html:p>
Most, if not all, "<html:code>.msg</html:code>" files are found within
the one cat file <html:a href="catalogs/msgfiles.html">msgfiles</html:a>.

			<notes>
				<note>
					Screens are always a preamble of text, sometimes followed by a list of up to ten options.
					If there are not that many choices, bogus entries (usually just numbered 1-10) fill the option slots.
				</note>
				<note>
					Some cards appear to be standardized (always ten options, with potion/saint/leave options in the same places).
				</note>

				<note>
					0x0a seems to be a newline, 0x14 seems to be a paragraph break.
					These are almost always used together as a pair {0x0a, 0x14},
					between every paragraph and each option.
				</note>
				<note>Usually the valid options start with {0x0a, 0x14}, but sometimes have an extra 0x14 or 0x15 appended (spacing?).</note>
				<note>0x15 is unknown.  Usually it follows the {0x0a, 0x14}, so it's probably whitespace?</note>
				<note>There is always an 0x1d between the "..." and the text of an option.</note>
				<note>An 0x10 immediately precedes the "..." for options that offer a popup potion selection.</note>
				<note>An 0x16 immediately precedes the "..." for options that offer a popup saint selection.</note>
				<note>An 0x06 immediately precedes the "..." for options that would cause the party to enter battle immediately.</note>
				<note>An 0x15 immediately precedes normal options. (thanks to James)</note>
